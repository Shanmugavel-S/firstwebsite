                        Erangel is the base map for the game. An 8x8 km map dotted with small outcroppings of buildings, the distance between major landmarks necessitates the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area.

Head armor will last until fully destroyed by gunfire or other types of damage and will block the full damage even if it has only 1 point of armor left. It is useful to pick up a helmet no matter what level it is as it provides protection against instant-kills with head shots, most of the time.

                        Light Machine Guns are essentially weapons that boast higher rate of fire over Assault Rifles and a slight increase in bullet damage, but with a much higher drop off in terms of range and ammo carrying capacity. While LMGs themselves can fire more bullets, they go through these bullets much faster, and because of how many of them there are, you go through them a lot faster too. This limits their usefulness dramatically.

                        Submachine Guns are great close-range weapons that have the accuracy of most Pistols but get the magazine size and fire rate of one of the Assault Rifles. While the aforementioned hit in accuracy can make a lot of these shots null, the ability to put so many bullets out in close range can very quickly overwhelm enemies and negate any positional or equipment benefit they might have.

                        Shotguns are weapons designed to fire shell cartridges that are different from normal bullet cartridges. Shells are usually loaded with a kind of pellets that can vary in size depending on the desired application. The shell is loaded with a wad that acts as a wall, pushing the pellets or payload out of the shell cartridge. This means that most rifles used for shooting shotgun shells uses normal barrels without rifling which makes them less effective for shooting bullets designed for rifled barrels.

                        The Flare gun is an extremely rare weapon that when fired, calls in a custom air drop that drops a larger amount of highly valuable equipment compared to the ordinary air drop. Once a flare is fired straight up into the air and reaches an altitude of 200 meters, a plane will soon fly over the map and drop off either a crate if the player is inside the safe zone, or a BRDM-2 if outside. Firing a flare at a player causes no damage

                    <p>Sniper Rifles are the ultimate weapons when it comes to range and power. In general, these rifles suffer from low magazine sizes and a cripplingly low rate of fire, but are redeemed by their high damage and extreme range capabilities. Due to the small magazine sizes and slow rate of fire, one must use these rifles with extreme caution, as one shot missed could spell the end for the user, and multiple shots missed means a long time of being vulnerable while reloading or switching weapons.

                        Assault Rifles are weapons with medium-high ammo capacity and the ability to place a lot of rounds downrange quickly. While they don't boast the ammo limit of Light Machine Guns, they trade it for a much higher accuracy. Similarly, there is a trade-off with higher accuracy weapons like DMRs or Sniper Rifles in that those weapons have a much lower rate of fire and ammo capacity compared to Assault Rifles

                        Pistols are great secondary weapons, but they can also function as primaries. Because they do decent damage at decent range, they're sort of an "all around okay" weapon. Replace with an actual main weapon as soon as you can, though, because the limited ammo carry and damage rating will harm you in the long run.

            PUBG's map is an atlas of danger and opportunity. Choosing where to land is a life or death decision. You can try to float to Battlegrounds' best loot spots and compete for gear, or take a more strategic approach, using the trajectory of the plane to predict quieter areas that will allow you to gear up in relative peace.

                    Georgopol is a massive northwestern city bisected by a river.

South Georgopol offers decent loot and medium risk.
